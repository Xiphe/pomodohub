# pomodohub
one shouldâ„¢ build a pomodoro app that integrates with GitHub issues and possibly other issue trackers

## Braindump

 - I really like GitHub-issues (exchangable with Jira/Bitbucket/GitLab/YouNameIt-issues as long as they're really close to the git repository)
 - I really like working in pomodoros (see http://pomodorotechnique.com/)
 - I use an app that is nicly placed in my task-bar and also syncs to my mobile.
 - I often find myself adding `Xiphe/some-project#123` as the task i'm doing pomodoros on
 - I want my pomodoro app to add comments to the GitHub issue about the amount of pomodoros I invested
